> what do you foresee for our future?

## Brief

FuturAI is an innovative online card game set in a speculative future where algorithms dictate every aspect of
life, from careers and relationships to leisure activities. The game incorporates elements of speculative
design, using a four-quadrant method to predict and explore potential futures.

As players navigate through the
game, they confront the implications of algorithmic control, making strategic decisions that affect not only
their in-game progress but also their understanding of a future shaped by technology and data-driven
insights..
