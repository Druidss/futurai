# Futurai
> what do you foresee for our future?


# Brief
          FuturAI is an innovative online card game set in a speculative future where algorithms dictate every aspect of
          life, from careers and relationships to leisure activities. The game incorporates elements of speculative
          design, using a four-quadrant method to predict and explore potential futures. </br>

          As players navigate through the
          game, they confront the implications of algorithmic control, making strategic decisions that affect not only
          their in-game progress but also their understanding of a future shaped by technology and data-driven
          insights..
